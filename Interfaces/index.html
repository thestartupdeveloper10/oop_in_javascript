    <!--An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods
        (and possibly properties) that a class must implement.
        It serves as a blueprint for creating classes and 
        helps achieve a level of abstraction by defining a common set of methods that different classes
        can adhere to.

    calculateArea() {
      // To be implemented by subclasses
    }

  // Implementing the interface
