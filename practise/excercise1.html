//Basic Class and Instance:
//Create a simple JavaScript class representing a "Person."
//The class should have properties such as name, age, and gender.
// Implement methods to set and get these properties.
// Create instances of the class and demonstrate the use of the methods.
class Person{
    constructor(name, age, gender){
        //encapsulation, modify age
       let _age = age;
        this.name = name;
        //this.age=age
        this.gender = gender
        //encapsulation function
        this.getAge=function(){
            return _age;
        }
    }
    getName(){
        return this.name;
    }
}

//Inheritance and Method Overriding:
//Extend the previous "Person" class to create a new class called "Student." 
//Add new properties such as studentId and grade.
//Implement a method specific to students, such as study().
//Demonstrate the use of method overriding by creating a new method with the same name in the "Student" class

class Student extends Person{
    constructor(name, age, gender,studentId, grade){
        super(name, age, gender)
        this.studentId=studentId
        this.grade=grade
    }
    study(subject){
        console.log("my favorite subject is " + subject)
    }
}

//Encapsulation and Private Members:
//Modify the "Person" class to use encapsulation. 
//Make the age property private and add a method to get the age instead.
//Ensure that external code cannot directly access or modify the age property. 
//Update the class instances to use the new encapsulated structure.

person=new Person('cliffe',40,'male');
student=new Student('james',20,'male',1,'A');
person.getName()
